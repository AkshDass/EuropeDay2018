                    <p class="text" style="padding-top:15vh">The European Union is a major supranational economic organization containing 28 member states. The EU’s goal is to increase economic stability through various means. </p>

                <p class="text" style="padding-top:5vh; font-size:2.25vh">The EU is the largest single market in the world. It allows for greater competition between businesses, leading to better goods and lower prices. 
                The EU also removes all trade barriers for partner countries which helps cut down business costs and increases efficiency. The EU also has policies within it that prevent the formation of monopolies and other anti-competitive practices. 
	            The EU also has standardized its own currency within its member nations and also allows its citizens to travel freely between member nations. This allows for more immigration and an even larger benefit to economies.</p>

                <p class="text" style="padding-top:5vh; font-size:2.25vh">The European Union is one of the strongest supranational groups in the world. Their influence in the recent sanctions on Russia have led them to be a key player in international diplomacy. 
                The EU has been trying to stimulate economic growth and political stability in Ukraine since 2014. Russia illegally annexed Crimea and deliberately attempted to destabilise Ukraine for their own benefit. This caused the EU to impose strict sanctions against Russia economically. 
                Diplomatically the EU G7 meeting in Brussels supported the suspension of Russia joining the OECD and International Energy Agency. Additionally, the EU-Russia summit was cancelled and they decided along with the member states to not hold bilateral talks with Russia. 
                The EU also suspended visa matters.</p>

                <p class="text" style="padding-top:5vh; font-size:2.25vh">Brexit” is shorthand for Britain’s Exit from the European Union. In June of 2016, Britain voted in a 52 - 48 favor of exiting the European Union. The official date for the exit of Britain is on March 29th 2019. 
                However, it is argued that the UK is able to halt the exit through a unilateral decision from its government. The legality of this procedure is disputed, but it allows for the UK a way out if they decide the exit is not the optimal decision. One of the main voting issues was on immigration. 
                Britain was pushing for more nationalistic, stricter immigration policies. While being in the EU, the UK was susceptible to large immigration from partner countries. In an attempt to minimize immigration to focus on its own citizens, the UK’s decision for brexit is logical. 
	            In terms of the current short-term macroeconomic effects, Britain has seen a negative trend. British income fell between 0.6 - 1.3% across the country. UK’s GDP saw a loss of 1.3%, and businesses are facing uncertainty. The long term predictions  are similar. 
	            The general consensus agrees that through less foreign investment, less immigration, and new trade barriers, brexit will inevitably cause a decline in UK’s economy.</p>
