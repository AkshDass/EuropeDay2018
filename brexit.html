                <p class="text" style="padding-top:5vh; font-size:2.25vh">Brexit” is shorthand for Britain’s Exit from the European Union. In June of 2016, Britain voted in a 52 - 48 favor of exiting the European Union. The official date for the exit of Britain is on March 29th 2019. 
                However, it is argued that the UK is able to halt the exit through a unilateral decision from its government. The legality of this procedure is disputed, but it allows for the UK a way out if they decide the exit is not the optimal decision. One of the main voting issues was on immigration. 
                Britain was pushing for more nationalistic, stricter immigration policies. While being in the EU, the UK was susceptible to large immigration from partner countries. In an attempt to minimize immigration to focus on its own citizens, the UK’s decision for brexit is logical. 
	            In terms of the current short-term macroeconomic effects, Britain has seen a negative trend. British income fell between 0.6 - 1.3% across the country. UK’s GDP saw a loss of 1.3%, and businesses are facing uncertainty. The long term predictions  are similar. 
	            The general consensus agrees that through less foreign investment, less immigration, and new trade barriers, brexit will inevitably cause a decline in UK’s economy.</p>
