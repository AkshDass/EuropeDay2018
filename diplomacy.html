                <p class="text" style="padding-top:5vh; font-size:2.25vh">The European Union is one of the strongest supranational groups in the world. Their influence in the recent sanctions on Russia have led them to be a key player in international diplomacy. 
                The EU has been trying to stimulate economic growth and political stability in Ukraine since 2014. Russia illegally annexed Crimea and deliberately attempted to destabilise Ukraine for their own benefit. This caused the EU to impose strict sanctions against Russia economically. 
                Diplomatically the EU G7 meeting in Brussels supported the suspension of Russia joining the OECD and International Energy Agency. Additionally, the EU-Russia summit was cancelled and they decided along with the member states to not hold bilateral talks with Russia. 
                The EU also suspended visa matters.</p>
