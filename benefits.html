                <p class="text" style="padding-top:5vh; font-size:2.25vh">The EU is the largest single market in the world. It allows for greater competition between businesses, leading to better goods and lower prices. 
                The EU also removes all trade barriers for partner countries which helps cut down business costs and increases efficiency. The EU also has policies within it that prevent the formation of monopolies and other anti-competitive practices. 
	            The EU also has standardized its own currency within its member nations and also allows its citizens to travel freely between member nations. This allows for more immigration and an even larger benefit to economies.</p>
